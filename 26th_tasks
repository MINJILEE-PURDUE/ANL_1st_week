## Tasks:

-Today's Non-Technical Tasks
1. Double check to complete I-9 and FNIS including all tax forms 
2. Sign in https://getsmarter.io/ for weekly meeting (need to figure out how to use it)

-Today's Technical Tasks
1. Watch the Node-RED demo video shared by Josh
2. Set up RPI and remind my previous zipper robot project with RPI.
   The goal of my research was to develop an apparel system which integrates intelligent autonomous agents, human-based sensors, wireless network protocol,
   mobile application management system and a zipper robot.
   the Raspberry Pi provides several key functions to the project:
   1) It is a main control hub of running on ESP8266 Wi-Fi MCU module
   2) It serves as a broker to connect to other networks through Wi-fi microchip and userâ€™s device.
   3) It acts as a local storage for the data packages sent and received between sockets.
   and there are several options to use MQTT
   1) Local Communication using Mosquitto (required only two terminals, and test: mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "test/message")
   2) Java with Agent and PAHO client
   3) MQTT Dash in Android Device
3. Check my personal IoT project for growing plants
   Ran on RPI, simple Node-RED design.
   Five DHT22 sensors were used and those data was sent to the HiveMQ cloud. (https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-cloud-broker/)

-Things to do
1. Remind SQL
2. Set up HiveMQ cloud active states
3. Watch other Node-RED demo videos relevant SAGE project
