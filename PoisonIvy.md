- Problem Statement(s)

While contact with poison ivy causes a reaction known as a cell-mediated immune response in humans, there is little solution to classify the plant in academic research studies or the industry.


e.g., The best control for poison ivy is to monitor frequently and remove plants promptly when they are found to avoid vines from becoming large and more difficult to control.

- Delimiations: RELATIVES:

Poison oak (Toxicodendron pubescens) is a low shrub bearing compound leaves with three leaflets, but the leaflet edges have rounded lobes and resemble oak leaves. The young twigs, petioles, and sometimes the leaves are covered with hairs.
Poison sumac (Toxicodendron vernix) is a tall shrub (to 5 meters) usually found in swamps. The leaves are (compound), odd pinnate. The 7-13 leaflets have smooth edges and pointed tips.
Some well-known tropical relatives are mango (Mangifera indica) and cashew nut (Anacardium occidentale).

Best season to detect the plant: In the spring, most sprouting poison ivy leaves are red in early spring, growing greener foliage as the weather warms. However, some may skip the red stage altogether.
In the summer, that gorgeous red color transitions into green once summer hits, making the plants much easier to miss. (Camouflage is cool and all, but really? Why canâ€™t it just stay an alarming shade of red year-round?)
