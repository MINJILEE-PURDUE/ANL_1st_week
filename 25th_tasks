## Tasks:

-Today's Non-Technical Tasks
1. Read the guidelines and instructions on Github
2. Sign in MIRO / JIRA
   (I guess MIRO is for planning, and JIRA is for process management. I need to read the guidelines again this week, especially calculating team capacities.)

-Today's Technical Tasks
1. Watch Docker tutorial videos and build up
2. Read Scrum Reference Card
3. Read SAGE Agile Scrum Software Development Process
  
  What I learn/understand is:
  Agile: Software Developer Methodology (less document-oriented, practical code-oriented compared to Waterfall model)
         Unlike previous methodologies that have been led through planning, agile method constantly creates prototypes with constant cycles,
         modifies the needs of each time and develops a single large piece of software.
  Scrum: Implementation of Agile Methodology
         It gives priority to the features and improvements to be included in the solution.
         It is based on object-oriented technology.
